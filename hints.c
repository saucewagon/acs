/**
 Hints on the basic logic of assignment 2, authored by Huan Wang
 
 The following design hints are based on my own implementation, you just take it as a reference. Do Not need to completely follow my design
 e.g., I do the service simulation(customer served by clerk) in customer thread(using usleep()), you can do it in clerk thread;
	   I create all the customer threads in one time, you can create these customer threads gradually according to the arrival time.
	   
 The time calculation could be confused, check the exmaple of gettimeofday on connex->resource->tutorial for more detail.

    int user_id;
	int service_time;
	int arrival_time;
};

/* global variables */
 
struct timeval init_time; // use this variable to record the simulation start time; No need to use mutex_lock when reading this variable since the value would not be changed by thread once the initial time was set.
double overall_waiting_time; //A global variable to add up the overall waiting time for all customers, every customer add their own waiting time to this variable, mutex_lock is necessary.
int queue_length[NQUEUE];// variable stores the real-time queue length information; mutex_lock needed

 1. condition_variables (and the corresponding mutex_lock) to represent each queue; 
 2. condition_variables to represent clerks
 3. others.. depend on your design
